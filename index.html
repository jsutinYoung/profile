                                    This was a Northwest Power & Conservation Council (NWCouncil) industrial sponsored project. I was responsible for the entire front-end design and implementation using Angular 6, High-Chart and Material Design. I also created a test backend in Nodes Express and SQLite. My team had created an application which utilized Machine Learning (ML) software to produce more accurate near-term energy forecasts for the NWCouncil, which are critical for various power transmission authorities and planning councils across the Pacific Northwest. The finished product produced recommendable result with a modern UI, which was showcased in NWCouncil annual user conference in 2019

                                    I created an iOS weather app, called WsuEather that was designed to give live weather data (via OpenWeatherAPI) to mobile phone users around the world. It can show the current weather conditions as well as a 5 day forecast with 3 hour interval of weather updates. The uniqueness of the app was it can display eight custom photos from iOS Gallery or taking a snap as background. This version must run on iPhone 6 or above , and iOS 10 or above.

                                    This project was to implement kernel threads, semaphore, convenient user-space thread function through the producer-consumer example in xv6 operating system which is a simple version of Linux operating system created by MIT. The result was that the test program behaved exactly like the kernel thread in Linux.
